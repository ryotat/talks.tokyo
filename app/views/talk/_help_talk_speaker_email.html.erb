<% if User.current %>
<%= my_observe_field '#'+@prefix+'speaker_email', :update => '#speakers', :url => "'%s?search='+value+'&prefix=%s'"%[talk_path(:action => 'speaker_email_list'), @prefix] %>
<% end %>
<ul>
<div id='speakers'>
</div>
</ul>

<% unless @prefix == "posted_talk_" %>
<p>If you check the box to the left then, after you click save, the speaker will be sent an e-mail message explaining how they can edit the talk. No e-mail will be sent unless the organiser's e-mail field has an e-mail address. You can do this more than once, and in doing so send your speaker several e-mails.</p>
